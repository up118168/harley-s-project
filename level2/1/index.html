 		Bright Star 
 	</title>
Bright star<br /><br />
Bright star, would I were steadfast as thou art <br /><br />
Not  <br /><br />
Not in lone splendour hung aloft the night <br /><br />
And Watching <br /><br />
And Watching, with eternal lids apart <br /><br />
Like   <br /><br />
Like nature's patient, sleepless Eremite<br /><br />
The moving waters <br /><br />
The moving waters at their priestlike task <br /><br />
Of pure ablution <br />
Of pure ablution round earth's human shores <br /><br />
Or gazing on <br /><br />
Or gazing on the new soft-fallen mask  <br /><br />
Of snow upon <br /><br />
Of snow upon the mountains and the moors<br /><br />
No-yet <br /><br />
No-yet still steadfast, still unchangeable<br /><br />
Pillow'd upon<br /><br />
Pillow'd upon my fair love's ripening breast<br /><br />
To feel for<br /><br />
To feel for ever its soft fall and swell<br /><br />
